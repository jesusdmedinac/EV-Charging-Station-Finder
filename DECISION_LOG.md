This document captures the key architectural and implementation decisions made during the development of the EV Charging Station Finder application.

## 2025-07-18

### Initial Project Setup
- **Decision**: Set up the initial project structure and version control
- **Details**: Created the initial Xcode project with iOS 14 as the minimum supported version

### Documentation
- **Decision**: Added initial project documentation
- **Details**: Created README.md with project overview and setup instructions

### Architecture Definition
- **Decision**: Adopted Clean Architecture with MVVM pattern
- **Details**: 
  - Defined core protocols for the application layers
  - Implemented a clear separation of concerns with distinct layers for Data, Domain, and Presentation

### Data Layer Implementation
- **Decision**: Structured the data layer with repository pattern
- **Details**:
  - Created models using JSON4Swift
  - Implemented API service for EV charging stations
  - Set up repository implementation for data management

### Dependency Injection
- **Decision**: Implemented dependency injection for better testability and modularity
- **Details**: Added DI container to manage dependencies between components

### Domain Layer
- **Decision**: Implemented use cases to encapsulate business logic
- **Details**: Created use cases to handle the core functionality of the application

### Presentation Layer
- **Decision**: Implemented MVVM pattern for the UI layer
- **Details**: 
  - Created ViewModel to handle business logic and state management
  - Implemented the main StationsListScreen

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Minimum iOS Version**
   - **Decision**: iOS 14.0 as minimum supported version
   - **Rationale**: Balances access to modern APIs with broad device support

2. **Architecture**
   - **Pattern**: Clean Architecture with MVVM
   - **Layers**:
     - **Data**: Handles data retrieval and persistence
     - **Domain**: Contains business logic and use cases
     - **Presentation**: Handles UI and user interactions

3. **Dependency Management**
   - **Approach**: Manual dependency injection
   - **Benefits**: Improved testability and separation of concerns

4. **Networking**
   - **Implementation**: Custom API service layer
   - **Data Format**: JSON
   - **Parsing**: Manual mapping from JSON to Swift models
